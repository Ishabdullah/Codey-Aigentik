A few fields are worth calling out specifically:

- **`owner.admin_email`** is new: an email arriving from this address is routed straight into the same command interpreter as a text from `admin_number` — see [Who Aigentik listens to as "the owner"](architecture.md#who-aigentik-listens-to-as-the-owner).
- **`sms.*`** exists in the config schema but nothing in the current codebase reads it — it's left over from an earlier version that polled a Termux SMS inbox directly. Harmless to leave as-is.
- **`behavior.require_confirmation_for_destructive`** and **`behavior.tone_matching`** describe intended behavior that isn't actually gated behind these flags in code today — the confirmation flow for destructive actions and tone detection both always run. Toggling these currently has no effect.
- **`llm.provider`** decides which AI backend `llama.js`'s `chat()` calls — everything in the app (reply generation, command interpretation, role-router classification, extraction) goes through that one function, so this one setting controls all of it. `local` (the default) talks to `llama.host` exactly as before; `gemini` talks to Google AI Studio's OpenAI-compatible endpoint using `gemini.api_key`/`gemini.model`; `vertex` talks to Google Vertex AI's native `generateContent` endpoint using `vertex.api_key`/`vertex.model` — a genuinely different Google product from `gemini` (different key format, different request shape, different model catalog: 2.0/1.5-series models 404 under Vertex AI Express Mode even when they work fine on AI Studio), not just an alternate name for the same one. Say **"use gemini"**, **"use vertex"**, or **"use local"** (also: "switch to gemini"/"switch to vertex"/"switch to local") to flip it live without restarting Aigentik — this is a runtime-only change (like `behavior.paused`), so it reverts to whatever `llm.provider` says here on the next restart; edit this field directly if you want a different persistent default. Say **"ai status"** to see which one is currently active. Switching to `gemini`/`vertex` fails with a clear message if the matching `api_key` is empty; at startup, the local `llama-server` process is only launched at all if `provider` is `local`, so a cloud-only setup doesn't need `llama.cpp` built or running.
- **Gemini 2.5 models think by default** — they can spend an entire small token budget (e.g. a 10-token warm-up ping) on invisible reasoning before producing visible text, which reads as an empty response. `chatVertex` in `llama.js` sets `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget: 0` to disable that, the same problem (and same fix shape) as the `enable_thinking: false` flag already set for the local Qwen model.
- **Vertex AI Express Mode's free-tier quota is easy to exhaust.** A single incoming customer message can trigger several LLM calls in a row (role classification, appointment-type detection's LLM fallback, field extraction, reply generation), and a `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` from one of those mid-conversation surfaces to the customer as a dropped or generic reply rather than a clear error — encountered during live testing with nothing more than a handful of messages in one conversation. Worth keeping in mind before relying on `vertex` (or `gemini`) as the sole provider for real traffic; `local` has no such external rate limit.

- **`core_api`** is required for `do-not-contact.js` to function at all: it writes through to Restoricon Core's `/api/v1/do-not-contact*` routes over HTTP, with no local-file fallback — a failed/misconfigured Core call throws rather than silently degrading, since a silent fallback here could mean a suppressed contact gets re-contacted. `token` must be a bearer token for a Core user with the `ai_agent` role (`restoricon_core/auth.py`'s `ROLE_AI_AGENT`); generate one from a Codey-OS checkout with `python -m tools.provision_ai_agent_auth` (reruns are idempotent — same user, fresh token each time). `base_url` must point at a running Restoricon Core API instance (`restoricon_core/api/server.py`, default port `8770`).

See [Installation](installation.md) for how `install.sh` generates a starter `config.json` for you, and [Data files](data-files.md) for everything else persisted under `data/`.
